# Meta-Learning and Surrogate Modeling to solve all issues in Feature Engineering

This is the GitHub project of my master thesis, where we want to use meta-learning and surrogate modeling to solve the following current issues in AutoFE:
- Not model specific
- Not taking into account model improvements by training
- Overfitting
- Takes a lot of time
